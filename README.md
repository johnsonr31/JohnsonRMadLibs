This program is a mad libs game, and will ask the user for various words, such as nouns, adjectives, verbs, and more specific words like proper nouns or countries. It will then print these words to the console in a story which might not make much sense depending on what words the user typed

Peer Review: Andrea Burr- i really like the story it was super funny but i wish it was more descriptive in what its asking for because a couple are discriptive but most arent i think it would make more sense if given more discription but overall i really like it
